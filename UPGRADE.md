## 4.x

This release comes with breaking changes to a couple of methods regarding uploading of files. To allow
for more flexibility when uploading file contents, instead of passing the path to the local file,
you are now required to read in the file contents before passing it to these methods. This change grants users more
freedom on how to read file contents/streams (e.g. external sources) as it will now allow any of the following
types `string|resource|StreamInterface|null` as `$body` parameter (previously `$localFilePath`).

The `3.x` branch will now no longer be maintained.

### ‼️ Breaking changes

- File contents/stream should now be explicitly read before passing to the following methods. Examples in
  the documentation have been updated.
    - [`BaseAPI::importDnsRecords`](https://toshy.github.io/BunnyNet-PHP/base-api/#import-dns-records)
      - Changed `$localFilePath` to `$body`.
    - [`EdgeStorageAPI::uploadFile`](https://toshy.github.io/BunnyNet-PHP/edge-storage-api/#upload-file)
        - Changed `$localFilePath` to `$body`.
    - [`StreamAPI::uploadVideo`](https://toshy.github.io/BunnyNet-PHP/stream-api/#upload-video)
        - Changed `$localFilePath` to `$body`.
- `BodyContentHelper::openFileStream` and `FileDoesNotExistException::class` have been removed.
    - While previously only used internally for the above-mentioned methods, the `openFileStream` was a public
      static method and could've theoretically been used by users, which is the reason for explicitly stating it here.

## 3.x

This release reworks (almost) the entire codebase, and therefore results in quite some breaking changes. Please
read the following notes carefully before upgrading.

The `2.x` branch will now no longer be maintained.

### ‼️ Breaking changes

- Request (PSR-18)
  - Addition of `Psr\Http\Client\ClientInterface` requires the user to construct a `BunnyClient`, and supply
  the `BunnyClient` to the API classes. Examples can be found in the [documentation website](https://ToshY.github.io/BunnyNet-PHP/base-api/).
- Response
  - Return type for public API methods changed from `array` to `ToshY\BunnyNet\Model\Client\BunnyClientResponse`:
      - Change from `$response['content']` to `$response->getContents()`
      - Change from `$response['headers']` to `$response->getHeaders()`
      - Change from `$response['status']['code']` to `$response->getStatusCode()`
      - Change from `$response['status']['info']` to `$response->getReasonPhrase()`
      - A new method `getBody()` was added.
- Endpoints
  - The following public classes have been **renamed**:
    - The class `BaseRequest` was renamed to `BaseAPI`.
    - The class `EdgeStorageRequest` was renamed to `EdgeStorageAPI`.
    - The class `PullZoneLogRequest` was renamed to `LoggingAPI`.
    - The class `VideoStreamRequest` was renamed to `StreamAPI`.
    - The class `SecureUrlGenerator` was renamed to `TokenAuthentication`.
        - The method `generate` was renamed to `sign`.
    - The class `ImageOptimizer` was renamed to `ImageProcessor`.
        - The argument `$optimizationCollection` was renamed to `$optimization`.
    - The class `PricingCalculator` was removed.
  - The following public methods have been **renamed**:
    - The method `listStorageZone` was renamed to `listStorageZones`.
    - The method `resetStorageZonePasswordByPath` was renamed to `resetStorageZonePassword`.
    - The method `getCollectionList` was renamed to `listCollections`.
    - The method `purgeCache` was renamed to `purgePullZoneCache`.
    - The method `addCustomCertificate` was renamed to `addCertificate`.
    - The method(s) having `the` in the name have been renamed.
        - `closeTheAccount` => `closeAccount`
    - The method(s) having lowercase abbreviations have been renamed to uppercase abbreviations.
        - `getDpaDetails` => `getDPADetails`
  - The following public methods have been **changed**:
    - The method `fetchVideoToCollection` was renamed to `fetchVideo`, therefore removing the original `fetchVideo` method.
      - The new `fetchVideo` method has the same arguments `fetchVideoToCollection` used to have.
  - Base API
    - The argument `$accountApiKey` was renamed to `$apiKey`.
  - Logging API
    - The argument `$accountApiKey` was renamed to `$apiKey`.
  - Edge Storage API
    - The argument `$hostCode` was changed to `$region` and now only accepts a `Region` case.
      - Example: For the `Falkenstein` region (previously `'FS'` code) this would now be `Region::FS` (default).
      - For a complete list of available `Region` cases, see the example in the [documentation website](https://ToshY.github.io/BunnyNet-PHP/edge-storage-api/#setup).

> Note: Please take in consideration that due to the impact of this release I cannot fully guarantee this list of
> breaking changes is complete. Thank you for your understanding.

### General Updates

- Styleguide
    - Regarding [PHP RFC: Class Naming](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/class-naming), class names with initialism, e.g. `API`,
      will be uppercase for the initialism part.
        - Variable names for instances of these classes will follow the camelCase naming convention.
            - E.g. `$baseApi` for the `BaseAPI` class.
        - Method names including an initialism will (still) follow the camelCase naming convention.
            - Example: get DPA details => `getDpaDetails`.
            - Example: get DNS zone => `getDnsZone`.
- Base API
